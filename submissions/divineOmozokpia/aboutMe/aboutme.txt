Thank you Dufuna for this great opportunity to learn.

At the end of this program, I aim to be proficient in both front-end and back-end languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments. 
I also intend to familiarise myself with more back-end languages and acquire web development skills to build sites and apps from start to finish.
