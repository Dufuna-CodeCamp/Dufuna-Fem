This README explains how to get started with this repository.

## How to get started
### Fork this repository.
In your fork, you'll find a submissions directory, create a new folder in that directory and name it <YOUR FULL NAME>.
In the last folder you created that is named after you, create another folder named the topic for which you want to make a submission, e.g. uxDesign.
In this new folder, create a new file for the solution of each tasks, e.g uxDesign.txt
Add your changes to git, make a commit and push to your forked version.
Head over to your forked version of this repository on Github and create a Pull Request to have your solution merged to this repository.
## How to make a submission
If you want to make a submission for a week where the topic was 'sample'

### Create a new branch.
Navigate to the folder that has your name in the submissions folder.
Create a folder for the task using the topic of the week as the name, e.g. Git&VersionControl
Add necessary files/content for the task to the folder.
Add the new files/content to git and commit your changes.
Push to your forked repository and subsequently make a Pull request to the main repository.
Keep checking to ensure your pull request has been merged or have comments so you can address as only merging of your pull request signifies task completion.
Pull Requests
When creating a pull request, you need to inform us of what you have done or changed. For example, if Emmanuel wants to create a pull request to submit a solution for the version control topic, it would go thus:

I added a versioncontrol.txt file that contains solution to the version control task.
I corrected the solution to the last task in lasttask.txt.
Keeping your Fork in Sync
As more content is added to this repository and more people contribute, your fork will fall out of date. This can sometimes lead to tricky situations with your pull requests. It's recommended to occasionally sync your fork with this repository.

Enjoy The Ride!!!
